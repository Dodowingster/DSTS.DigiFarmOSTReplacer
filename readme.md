The original **"DIGITAL PLANET"** theme is replaced with the iconic **Hunt Screen music from *Digimon World Championship***. This change is perfect for players who prefer a more energetic and intense background track over the default galactic and space-themed ambiance, giving the DigiFarm a fresh, engaging feel.
